** Finished today
    Today I encoded definitions for nodes in a file, and loaded them into an ETS table with ~file:consult/1~
    This ETS table is wrapped in a ~gen_server~ so that it can be included in a supervision tree.
** Working on
    ~ua_binary.erl~ implementing all the datatypes.
    Currently workind on the NodeID (and how to handle the flags).
    Also, what is a Numeric if it doesn't fit in 2byte/4byte? Is it 8 byte?

** Finished Today
   fixed 2/4 byte node id encoding scheme. Added the ETS table for definitions to the App + Supervisior

   > Also, what is a Numeric if it doesn't fit in 2byte/4byte? Is it 8 byte?
   It's 4 byte in this case.
